# General Interactive Video Upload Automation

## Basic routine

1. upload videos via https://member.bilibili.com/preupload, and along with the only cover.

2. upload skeleton via https://member.bilibili.com/x/vu/web/add?csrf=, according to this format:

```json
{"copyright":1, // 1 for copyright, 2 for copyleft
"videos":
[{"filename":"m201214(no file extension)","title":"pic","desc":"","cid":0},{"filename":"mfilename","title": "final","desc":"","cid":0},{"filename": "mxx","title":"sxx","desc":"","cid":0}] //the cid will be assigned later by bilibili.
,"no_reprint":1,
"interactive":1,
"tid":171,
"cover":"//i0.xx.com/xx.jpg",
"title":"interactive_video_final",
"tag":"互动视频",
"desc_format_id":39, // not sure about this one. it says we can use chinese downtick to specify the game names prefixed by "related games:".
"desc":"",
"dynamic":"#互动视频#",
"open_elec":1, //allow to get financial support.
"subtitle":{"open":1,"lan":""}, //language not specified.
"up_close_reply":false,
"up_close_danmu":false
}
```

3. **GET** cids from https://member.bilibili.com/x/web/archive/view?bvid=<bv_id>

4. edit and **POST** the final worldline to https://api.bilibili.com/x/stein/graph/save

## Workflow

Basically we need a template to handle network requests.

And we need all cookies be prepared beforehand. If it is not necessary to use extra cookies then we are good, leaving the collective work out.

Finally, a template to do worldline script assignments.
